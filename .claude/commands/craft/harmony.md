# The Craft of Harmony

## Philosophy
A harmonious system has no seams.

## Process

### Step 1: Map Touchpoints
Where does this component interact with others?
- What data does it receive?
- What data does it emit?
- What callbacks does it trigger?

### Step 2: Test Boundaries
At each boundary:
- What happens with nil/empty data?
- What happens with extreme data?
- Do animations coordinate properly?

### Step 3: Unify Patterns
Components in the same family should:
- Use the same spacing tokens
- Use the same animation curves
- Respond to the same gestures
- Handle errors the same way
