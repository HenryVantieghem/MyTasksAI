# The Craft of Polish

## Philosophy
Every screen should be worthy of the App Store.

## Process

### Visual Audit
1. Take simulator screenshot
2. Review at 100% zoom:
   - Alignment precise?
   - Spacing consistent?
   - Colors correct?
   - Text readable?

### Interaction Audit
1. Tap every tappable element
2. Scroll every scrollable area
3. Test every state:
   - Empty state
   - Loading state
   - Error state
   - Full data state

### Animation Audit
1. Record screen
2. Watch at 0.5x speed
3. Check:
   - Smooth transitions?
   - Appropriate duration?
   - Natural easing?

## Output
List of specific fixes needed, prioritized.
