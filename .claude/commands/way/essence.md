# The Way of Essence

## Philosophy
"The Vibe Coder builds without laboring, accomplishes without expectation."

## When to Use
Before adding a new feature or when a feature feels bloated.

## Process

### Step 1: State the User Need
In one sentence: What problem does this solve for the user?
Not what it does. What need it meets.

### Step 2: Find the Minimum
What is the absolute minimum implementation that meets this need?
- No "nice to haves"
- No "while we're at it"
- No "in case they want to"

### Step 3: Resist Addition
Before adding anything beyond minimum:
- Sleep on it
- Build the minimum first
- See if users actually ask for more

## Mantra
"Meet difficulties while simple; solve major issues while minor."
