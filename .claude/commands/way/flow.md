description: Remove friction from user paths

# The Way of Flow

## Philosophy
"Restrictions breed resistance; freedom enables prosperity."

## Process

### Step 1: Walk the Path
Use the app as a user would. Notice:
- Where do you hesitate?
- Where do you have to think?
- Where does progress feel blocked?

### Step 2: Remove Obstacles
For each friction point:
- Can the step be eliminated entirely?
- Can it be combined with another step?
- Can it happen automatically?

### Step 3: Trust the User
- Remove confirmation dialogs that aren't protecting destructive actions
- Remove tutorials that explain obvious things
- Let the interface teach through use

## Mantra
"Source does nothing, yet through it all things are done."
