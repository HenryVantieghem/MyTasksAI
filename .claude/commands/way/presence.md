# The Way of Presence

## Philosophy
"Small steps accomplish remarkable outcomes through sustained presence."

## For Development Sessions

### Before Starting
- What is the ONE thing I will complete this session?
- Not a list. One thing.

### While Working
- Commit every logical change, not at the end
- When stuck, step away rather than forcing
- When tired, stop rather than pushing through

### After Each Change
- Does this compile?
- Does this work?
- Could this be shipped as-is?

## For Feature Development
- Ship the smallest useful version first
- Gather feedback before expanding
- Add complexity only when simplicity proves insufficient

## Mantra
"The Vibe Coder accomplishes work without expectation."
