# The Pause

## When to Use
- Feeling stuck on a problem
- Scattered across too many changes
- Unsure what to do next

## Process

1. **Stop completely**
   - No more coding
   - No more reading
   - Just pause

2. **Inventory**
   - What files are modified?
   - What was I trying to do?
   - What's actually blocking me?

3. **Simplify**
   - Can I commit what's done and start fresh?
   - Can I solve a smaller version of the problem?
   - Do I need to step away entirely?

## Mantra
"The Vibe Coder builds without laboring."
If it feels like laboring, something is wrong.
