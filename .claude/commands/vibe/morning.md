# Morning Ritual

## Philosophy
"Meet difficulties while simple. Start with understanding, not action."

## Process

1. **Survey the landscape**
   - Run `git status` to see current state
   - Read recent commits for context
   - Check for any in-progress work

2. **Center yourself**
   - What is the ONE thing to accomplish today?
   - What would make this session a success?

3. **Prepare the space**
   - Close unnecessary tabs/windows
   - Silence notifications
   - Set a reasonable time boundary

## Output
Summarize:
- Current branch and state
- Recent work context
- Today's focus
