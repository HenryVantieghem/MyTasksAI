description: End session cleanly with commits and context preservation

# Evening Ritual

## Process

1. **Complete or stash**
   - Commit all complete work with clear messages
   - Stash any incomplete work with descriptive names
   - Leave no uncommitted chaos

2. **Document context**
   - What was accomplished?
   - What's next?
   - Any blockers or open questions?

3. **Clean the workspace**
   - Close debugging views
   - Reset simulator state
   - Clear temporary files

## For Tomorrow
Leave a note for future-you:
- Where to pick up
- What was the mental model
- Any "aha" moments worth preserving
